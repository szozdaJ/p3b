add two system calls; clone and join
clone creates a new thread which shares the address space (shares the variables and process local stuff
join waits for the cloned address to exit
create a thread library to call this routine, malloc, returns PID to parent and 0 to child (-1 if fail)
thread join should use the child thread

lock implemented should be a simple spin lock, not a ticket
